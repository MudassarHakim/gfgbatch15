Configuring your email and identity with GitHub using Git involves setting up your Git configuration to associate your commits with a specific email address and username. This information is used to attribute the commits to the correct user on GitHub.

Here's how you can configure your email and identity with GitHub using Git:

1. Set your Git username and email globally:
bash
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Replace "Your GitHub Username" with your actual GitHub username and "your.email@example.com" with the email associated with your GitHub account.

2. Verify your settings:
You can verify that your settings have been applied correctly by running:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --get user.name
git config --global --get user.email
This should display the values you've set for user.name and user.email.
