If u are doing it for the very first time :

make a folder anywhere on your machine
open git bash at the location

write the command
git clone https://github.com/iampsrv/gfgbatch15

you should see the "gfgbatch15" in your machine.
you will notice that you have all the changes in this "gfgbatch15" folder, which you were seeing on github as well.

-----------------------

if you already have the "gfgbatch15" folder (which mean u have performed the git clone in the past)
all you need to do is:
open the "gfgbatch15" folder.
open git bash at this position
write the command : 
git pull origin master

this would all the changes which are there on github but not there in your personal machine (local)
